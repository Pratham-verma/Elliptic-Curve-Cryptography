# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

The [**Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve\_cryptography) is modern **family of public-key cryptosystems**, which is based on the algebraic structures of the **elliptic curves over finite fields** and on the difficulty of the [**Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve\_cryptography#Rationale).

**ECC** implements all major capabilities of the asymmetric cryptosystems: **encryption**, **signatures** and **key exchange**.

The **ECC cryptography** is considered a natural modern **successor of the RSA** cryptosystem, because ECC uses **smaller keys** and signatures than RSA for the same level of security and provides very **fast key generation**, **fast key agreement** and **fast signatures**.
